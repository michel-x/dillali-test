# Getting Started with Dillali Test

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Install the depedencies

At first you need to install the depedencies: \
*npm install*  


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.



### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
You may serve it with a static server like **serve** :

*npm install -g serve* \
*serve -s build*  

Open the link indicated in the console (probably [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) ) to view it in the browser.



### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
